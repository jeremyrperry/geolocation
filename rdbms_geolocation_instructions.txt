A Drupal Geolocation Module

RDBMS Geolocaiton setup

--------------------------------------------------

Setup of the Maxmind IP Geolocation data into an RDBMS is a mostly straightforward process that can be done with virtually any DB admin application.  The tables are provided on the install, so a few steps will get you up and running.

1) Download either the Geolite or Geoip CSV data from Maxmind.
2) Whether using the geolite or geoip versions, Maxmind provides two CSV files.  The file name ending in -Blocks and -Locations correlates to the geolocation_ip_locations and geolocation_cities tables respectively.
3) In both files, delete the Maxmind copyright notice, as it will interfere with the import process.
4) In the blocks file, replace the existing headers (startIpNum, endIpNum, locId) with the new headers (start_ip_num, end_ip_num, loc_id).
4d) In the location file, replace the existing headers (locId, country, region, city, postalCode, latitude, longitude,	metroCode, areaCode) with the new headers (id, country, state_region, postal_code, lat, lng, dma_code, area_code).
6) Using a db admin application of your choice, import the CSV files into their respective tables.

Note:  The Locations file sometimes has issues in some db admin programs because of the formatting Maxmind uses, Shift JIS.  This can occur even when the geolocation_cities table is encoded the same way.  If you encounter this problem, I have a PHP/MySQL application available on GitHub that will do the import without issue.
