A Drupal Geolocation Module

Mongodb Setup

--------------------------------------------------

This module comes with the optional availability to have its data sources in a Mongodb database/collection setup.  While Mongodb can offer many advantages over a traditional RDBMS setup with performance and scalability, it should only implmeneted if it best suits your site's needs and must be set up by a knowledgeable developer.   Use of Drupal's mongodb module will be required.  Using Mongodb will override the use of the standard RDBMS tables in the module, except for the applicable IP collections if using the binary database. 

Instructions:

1) If you haven't already done so, install mongodb on your server.  Detailed instructions for your platform can be found here:  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
2) Install the Drupal mongodb driver on your site, following all instructions.
3) On the command line, navigate to the module's mongodb directory and type in the following command:  mongorestore.  This will create a database called geolocation.
4) Import the applicable CSV files as necessary for the geolocation_dma, geolocation_cities, and geolocation_ip_locations collections.  This process can be omitted for the geolocation_ip_locations and geolocation_cities collections if you intend to use the binary database.  Importing the DMA information can likewise be omitted if you don't intend to use that feature.  Skip to step 5 if desired.
	4a) Whether using the geolite or geoip versions, Maxmind provides two CSV files.  The file name ending in -Blocks and -Locations correlates to the geolocation_ip_locations and geolocation_cities collections respectively.
	4b) In both files, delete the Maxmind copyright notice, as it will interfere with the import process.
	4c) In the blocks file, replace the existing headers (startIpNum, endIpNum, locId) with the new headers (start_ip_num, end_ip_num, loc_id).
	4d) In the location file, replace the existing headers (locId, country, region, city, postalCode, latitude, longitude,	metroCode, areaCode) with the new headers (id, country, state_region, postal_code, lat, lng, dma_code, area_code).
	4e) The DMA information is automatically included as a part of the RDBMS setup and can easily be exported as a CSV with most any db admin application.
	4f) Import the CSV file(s) into the database.  Detailed instructions on CSV imports can be found here:  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/import-export/
5) On approximately line 16 in inc/class.geolocation_basic_abstract.inc, change the $useMongo variable value to true.
6) Clear the Drupal cache.
